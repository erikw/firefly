# EVENT CHAINING
	Should implement some sort of chaining of events. This would allow us to
	close channels when a connection is closed, e.g:

	conn_close -> chan_close_ev -> chan_close_ev -> conn_close_ev

    This would save us from relying on event priority to synchronize the
    order of execution of events.

	HOWTO:
	Every event has an id. When adding an event, specify the id of each event
	it depends on. When executing an event, iterate through each dependency,
	find the referenced event and if it is not yet executed, execute it.

# HALF OPEN CONNECTION
    Impl. half open on connections, can send but not receive on a half
    open.  When closing a connection, it should be set to HALF_OPEN to
    disallow receiving new stuff on it while allowing channel close
    packets to be sent.

    Possibly also implement an ERROR state on the connection.

# TEST STUFF
    The eth_posix test suite fails infrequently on a ubu10.04 32b vm
    with incorrect sender etc. Not reproducible on ubu12.04 64b.

    Try limiting the pingpong suite to first open channel and then
    continue.

# Better Build system
	- CMake in the works!

# Seperate LabComm, RTOS\LWIP, Firefly from eachother.
	- Firefly should not include LabComm but rather depend on it. Path to
	  headers and libs should be configurable (through cmake?)
