# CMAKE
	Stuff left to do:
		- Avoid compiling LWIP if it doesn't exist on the compiling
		  computer.
		- Add test_proto_memman to src/test/CMakeLists.txt when it has
		  been fixed (see # TEST STUFF below).
		- Look through the entire Makefile to see if there are targets
		  left to move over to CMake.

# EVENT CHAINING
	Should implement some sort of chaining of events. This would allow us to
	close channels when a connection is closed, e.g:

	conn_close -> chan_close_ev -> chan_close_ev -> conn_close_ev

    This would save us from relying on event priority to synchronize the
    order of execution of events.

	HOWTO:
	Every event has an id. When adding an event, specify the id of each event
	it depends on. When executing an event, iterate through each dependency,
	find the referenced event and if it is not yet executed, execute it.

# HALF OPEN CONNECTION
    Impl. half open on connections, can send but not receive on a half
    open.  When closing a connection, it should be set to HALF_OPEN to
    disallow receiving new stuff on it while allowing channel close
    packets to be sent.

    Possibly also implement an ERROR state on the connection.

# GENERAL STUFF THAT NEEDS FIXING
	- In firefly_connection_actions there are two function pointers that
	  handle errors; connection_error and channel_error. Neither lets the
	  user now what the error was, only that AN error occurred. This
	  should be fixed. When it comes to connection_error, the enum
	  firefly_errors should be used since these are already printed when
	  an error occurs. The same enum could possibly be used for
	  channel_error as well.
	- We need to go through all of Firefly and fix error handling. E.g.
	  when malloc:ing, it's _NOT_ OK check for error, print error
	  message and then keep executing. There's A LOT of stuff like this.

# TEST STUFF
	- The eth_posix test suite fails infrequently on a ubu10.04 32b vm
      with incorrect sender etc. Not reproducible on ubu12.04 64b.

	- Try limiting the pingpong suite to first open channel and then
	  continue.

	- Fix test_proto_memman, it currently doesn't even compile.

# Seperate LabComm, RTOS\LWIP, Firefly from eachother.
	- Firefly should not include LabComm but rather depend on it. Path to
	  headers and libs should be configurable (through cmake?)
