# CMAKE
	Stuff left to do:
		- Avoid compiling LWIP if it doesn't exist on the compiling
		  computer.
		- Add test_proto_memman to src/test/CMakeLists.txt when it has
		  been fixed (see # TEST STUFF below).
		- Look through the entire Makefile to see if there are targets
		  left to move over to CMake.
		- Make use of DEBUG vs RELEASE builds that enables or disables
		  the CFLAGs -g and -O[0-3] (and possibly more).

# HALF OPEN CONNECTION
    Impl. half open on connections, can send but not receive on a half
    open.  When closing a connection, it should be set to HALF_OPEN to
    disallow receiving new stuff on it while allowing channel close
    packets to be sent.

    Possibly also implement an ERROR state on the connection.
	
	Refactor connection state to be an enum.

# GENERAL STUFF THAT NEEDS FIXING
	- In firefly_connection_actions there are two function pointers that
	  handle errors; connection_error and channel_error. Neither lets the
	  user know what the error was, only that an error occurred. This
	  should be fixed. When it comes to connection_error, the enum
	  firefly_errors should be used since these are already printed when
	  an error occurs. The same enum could possibly be used for
	  channel_error as well.
	- We need to go through all of Firefly and fix error handling. E.g.
	  add something more than the (sometimes) existing error prints
	  for when malloc() fails. (Fixed in POSIX transports.)
	- Consider letting connection_error callback return bool indicating whether
	  or not to propagate the error to each channel as well. Would be useful if
	  channels from multiple connections are bundled and the code using the
	  channels are not aware of the connections. Possible use case: ExtCtrl
	- Currently when closing everything there might be a double free if the app
	  first calls firefly_connection_close and then
	  firefly_transport_llp_*_free. This is due to the connection is not
	  removed from the llp until freed so the llp might try to close an already
	  closed connection. firefly_connection_close should be able to handle
	  mutliple calls on the same connection, call error or ignore. llp free
	  might check the open state of a connection before trying to close it.

# TEST STUFF
	- The eth_posix test suite fails infrequently on a ubu10.04 32b vm
	  with incorrect sender etc. Not reproducible on ubu12.04 64b.
	  (These looks like packets sent from another adapter. Why
	  they show up on loopback is undetermined.)

	- Try limiting the pingpong suite to first open channel and then
	  continue. (What does this mean?)

	- Fix test_proto_memman, it currently doesn't even compile.

# Seperate LabComm, RTOS\LWIP, Firefly from eachother.
	- Firefly should not include LabComm but rather depend on it. Path to
	  headers and libs should be configurable (through cmake?)
