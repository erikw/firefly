The eth_posix test suite fails infrequently on a ubu10.04 32b vm with
incorrect sender etc. Not reproducible on ubu12.04 64b.

Try limiting the pingpong suite to first open channel and then continue.

fix event driven connection open, at least add connection to llp
 - Make add conn to llp an event with highest priority
