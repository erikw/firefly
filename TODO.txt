The eth_posix test suite fails infrequently on a ubu10.04 32b vm with
incorrect sender etc. Not reproducible on ubu12.04 64b.

Try limiting the pingpong suite to first open channel and then continue.

fix event driven connection open, at least add connection to llp
 - Make add conn to llp an event with highest priority

Fix timeout in UDP.

Fix reliability of signatures:
 - Suggestion, force user to specify the types when opening the channel and
   disallow adding new types after channel is opened. This may be done by
   setting a callback that is called when the types can be registered. The
   purpose of this is to make use of the handshake to request and accept
   labcomm types. Each node will during setup send its signatures. When a
   signature is recieved and verified by the application an ack packet is sent
   for that specific signature. When a node has sent an ack packet for each
   received signature and recieved an ack packet for each transmitted
   signature the channel is considered open and ready.
   The application verifies a signature by making sure the labcomm decoder will
   not generate an error when reading the signature. This is achived by either
   adding the type before the signature is read or by implementing the unknown
   datatype callback and registering the type there.
   Typical usage: 1. define a callback which takes the channel as input, the
   function should use the labcomm api to register each type. 2. Open channel
   and specify the callback. 3. The protocol will call the callback when it is
   ready to send the signatures.
