Connection close:
* Should be implemented att protocol layer.
* Should imply no new channels may be started.
* should imply no data may be transmitted on any open channel.
* All channels should be closed.
* Only packets concerning closing channels may be transmitted.
* Connection may only be free'd if connection is closed and no channels are
	open.
* Close connection is a funtion available to the application level.
* Free connection might be considered a private funktion of possible. Consider
	who knows when and how to free.
* Consider two levels of free, one freeing everything except the connection
	struct and the 'open' attribute, and the other freeing everthing. This would
	try to prevent any segmentation fault due to events accessing the connection
	after it beeing free. The events saftely check the open attribute but if it
	is set to freed nothing else may be accessed. This would in turn imply more
	overhead freeing resources and resources not beeing completely freed. How
	else could events be safe? Removing all events accessing a certain
	connection could be removed from the event queue as an alternative.
